Labs and lecture code for CS 546 - Web Programming at Stevens Institute of Technology (F20).

## Description

This course will provide students with a first strong approach of internet programming. It will give the basic knowledge on how the Internet works and how to create advanced web sites by the use of script languages, after learning the basics of HTML. The course will teach the students how to create a complex global site through the creation of individual working modules, giving them the skills required in any business such as proper team work and coordination between groups.

## Warning

Prof. Hill has a copy of my projects and cross-checks them with submissions through MOSS.
